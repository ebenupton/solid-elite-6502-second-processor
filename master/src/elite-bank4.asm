\       Name: ylookup
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Drawing pixels
\    Summary: Lookup table for converting pixel y-coordinate to page number of
\             screen address
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Elite's screen mode is based on mode 1, so it allocates two pages of screen
\ memory to each character row (where a character row is 8 pixels high). This
\ table enables us to convert a pixel y-coordinate in the range 0-247 into the
\ page number for the start of the character row containing that coordinate.
\
\ Screen memory is from &4000 to &7DFF, so the lookup works like this:
\
\   Y =   0 to  7,  lookup value = &40 (so row 1 is from &4000 to &41FF)
\   Y =   8 to 15,  lookup value = &42 (so row 2 is from &4200 to &43FF)
\   Y =  16 to 23,  lookup value = &44 (so row 3 is from &4400 to &45FF)
\   Y =  24 to 31,  lookup value = &46 (so row 4 is from &4600 to &47FF)
\
\   ...
\
\   Y = 232 to 239, lookup value = &7A (so row 31 is from &7A00 to &7BFF)
\   Y = 240 to 247, lookup value = &7C (so row 32 is from &7C00 to &7DFF)
\
\ There is also a lookup value for y-coordinates from 248 to 255, but that's off
\ the end of the screen, as the special Elite screen mode only has 31 character
\ rows.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Ready-made bytes for plotting one-pixel points in mode 2 (the bottom part of
\ the split screen).
\
\ In mode 2, each character row is one byte, which is two pixels. Rows 0 and 1
\ of the table contain a character row byte with just the left pixel plotted,
\ while rows 2 and 3 contain a character row byte with just the right pixel
\ plotted.
\
\ In other words, looking up row X will return a character row byte with pixel
\ X/2 plotted (if the pixels are numbered 0 and 1).
\
\ There are two extra rows to support the use of CTWOS+2,X indexing in the CPIX2
\ routine. The extra rows are repeats of the first two rows, and save us from
\ having to work out whether CTWOS+2+X needs to be wrapped around when drawing a
\ two-pixel dash that crosses from one character block into another. See CPIX2
\ for more details.

\ ******************************************************************************
\
\       Name: LOINQ (Part 4 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a shallow line going right and down or left and up
\  Deep dive: Elite's line-drawing algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going right and down (no swap) or left and up (swap)
\
\   * X1 < X2 and Y1 <= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at top left to (X2, Y2) at bottom right, omitting the
\     first pixel
\
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ BBC Micro cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The
\ algorithm is unchanged, it's just a lot longer.

                        \
                        \ We therefore have the following:

                        \ is now a larger number and SC is smaller. This means
                        \ we can increment Y to move down a line, as per usual,
                        \ but we can test for when it reaches the bottom of the

\       Name: LOINQ (Part 7 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a steep line going up and right or down and left
\  Deep dive: Elite's line-drawing algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going up and right (no swap) or down and left (swap)
\
\   * X1 >= X2 and Y1 >= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at bottom left to (X2, Y2) at top right, omitting the
\     first pixel
\
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ BBC Micro cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The
\ algorithm is unchanged, it's just a lot longer.

\    Summary: Lookup table for two-pixel mode 1 orange pixels for the sun
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Blocks of orange (as used when drawing the sun) have alternate red and yellow
\ pixels in a cross-hatch pattern. The cross-hatch pattern is made up of offset
\ rows that are 2 pixels high, and it is made up of red and yellow rectangles,
\ each of which is 2 pixels high and 1 pixel wide. The result looks like this:
\
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\   ...yryryryryryryryr...
\   ...yryryryryryryryr...
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\
\ and so on, repeating every four pixel rows.
\
\ This is implemented with the following lookup table, where bits 0-1 of the
\ pixel y-coordinate are used as the index, to fetch the correct pattern to use.
\
\ Rows with y-coordinates ending in %00 or %01 fetch the red/yellow pattern from
\ the table, while rows with y-coordinates ending in %10 or %11 fetch the
\ yellow/red pattern, so the pattern repeats every four pixel rows.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called after the ships in the hangar have been drawn, so all
\ it has to do is draw the hangar's background.
\
\ The hangar background is made up of two parts:
\
\   * The hangar floor consists of 11 screen-wide horizontal lines, which start
\     out quite spaced out near the bottom of the screen, and bunch ever closer
\     together as the eye moves up towards the horizon, where they merge to give
\     a sense of perspective
\
\   * The back wall of the hangar consists of 15 equally spaced vertical lines
\     that join the horizon to the top of the screen
\
\ The ships in the hangar have already been drawn by this point, so the lines
\ are drawn so they don't overlap anything that's already there, which makes
\ them look like they are behind and below the ships. This is achieved by
\ drawing the lines in from the screen edges until they bump into something
\ already on-screen. For the horizontal lines, when there are multiple ships in
\ the hangar, this also means drawing lines between the ships, as well as in
\ from each side.

\ Set A and X to the colours we should use for indicators showing dangerous and

\
\ If flashing is enabled, the colour returned in A (dangerous values) will be

\ going back to red. If we always use PZW to decide which colours we should use
\ when updating indicators, flashing colours will be automatically taken care of
\ for us.
\
\ The values returned are #GREEN2 for green and #RED2 for red. These are mode 2
\ bytes that contain 2 pixels, with the colour of each pixel given in four bits.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The indicator can show a vertical bar in 16 positions, with a value of 8
\ showing the bar in the middle of the indicator.
\
\ In practice this routine is only ever called with A in the range 1 to 15, so

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The offset of the vertical bar to show in the indicator,
\                       from 0 at the far left, to 8 in the middle, and 15 at
\                       the far right
